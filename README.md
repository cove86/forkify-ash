# Forkify Project

Final project in The Complete javascript Course 2022 From Zero to Expert! by Jonas Schedtmann. HTML & SASS was provided in the Starter files and all Javascript was written by myself durin gthe tutorial. Built using the model-view-controller design pattern, also used parcel to build the site and it is now deployed to netlify.

The Functionality added was the ability to search for recipes (results were from an API) and then display the results across multiple pages, ability to bookmark
a recipe which would then display in the bookmark view and ability to add a recipe. 

Live site is https://forkify-ash.netlify.app/
